1] USER 1 was not able login with username = user1@gmail.com & password = user1ABC, 
   Controller was returning two identical records from database. 

2] Databases entries inserting through INSERT Query at application StartUp was sending two duplicate records, 
   which was causing issue. 
   
3] Changes I have made :
	
	a] Added Custom Exception Handler Class 
	
	b] To make database entry unique changed insert query in db.changelog-1.0.xml file.
	
	c] Added unique constraint to login_id field, so no duplication at the time of sign up.
	
	d] Added check while inserting user data in database whether Data is already present or not .
